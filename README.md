# EMNIST-Classifier
Creating an EMNIST Classifier. 

My Plan for this Project

1. Create the model in jupyter notebooks and make the accuracy like 95+
2. Practice Github from the terminal.
3. Save the model and make it accessible in GitHub so that I can use that model to do the predictions.
4. Learn html and css and use that to create the website. 
5. Learn TensorFlow.js
6. After learning that, take the model from python and put it on the website with js.
**I am done with the model right now.**
