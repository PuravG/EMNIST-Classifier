# EMNIST-Classifier
This is my Replicate Project and I am creating an EMNIST Classifier. 

My Plan for this Project

1. Create the model in jupyter notebooks and make the accuracy like 95+
2. Learn GitHub and get good at it.
3. Save the model and make it accessible in GitHub so that I can just use that model to do the predict.
4. Learn html and css and use that to create the website and make it look good. 

**I am on step number 4 right now.** *I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript from codecademy right now*

5. Learn TensorFlow.js
6. After learning that, take the model from python and hopefully put it on the website.
7. Write an article and make a replicate video
8. Maybe post it on linkedln
