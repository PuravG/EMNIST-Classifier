# EMNIST-Classifier
This is my Replicate Project and I am creating an EMNIST Classifier. 

My Plan for this Project

1. Create the model in jupyter notebooks and make the accuracy like 95+
2. Learn GitHub and get good at it.
3. Save the model and make it accessible in GitHub so that I can just use that model to do the predict.

**I am on step number 3 right now.** *I need to create the notebook for my model and add in my comments and explanations, then I will upload to github.*

4. Create a free website, probably hosted by GitHub 
5. Learn html and css and use that to create the website and make it look good. 
6. Learn TensorFlow.js
7. After learning that, take the model from python and hopefully put it on the website.
8. Write an article and make a replicate video
9. Maybe post it on linkedln
