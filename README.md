# EMNIST-Classifier
Creating an EMNIST Classifier. 

My Plan for this Project

1. Create the model in jupyter notebooks and make the accuracy like 95+
2. Practice Github from the terminal.
3. Save the model and make it accessible in GitHub so that I can use that model to do the predictions.
4. Learn html and css and use that to create the website. 

**I am on step number 4 right now.** *I am creating the static website.

5. Learn TensorFlow.js
6. After learning that, take the model from python and put it on the website with js.
7. Write an article and make a replicate video explaining how it works and stuff.
8. Add it to portfolio and post on socials.
